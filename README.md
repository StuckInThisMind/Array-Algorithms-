# Java Array Operations

This repository contains Java classes implementing various array operations. These operations include:

1. Separating Even and Odd Numbers
2. Finding Nearest Index in an Array
3. Converting Array to ArrayList and Vice Versa

## 1. EvenOddNumbers Class

### Description
This class separates the even and odd numbers entered by the user into separate arrays.

### Methods
- `execute()`: Prompts the user to input the number of elements, accepts the numbers, and then separates them into even and odd arrays.

## 2. NearestIndexFinder Class

### Description
This class finds the index of the nearest neighbors in an array.

### Methods
- `execute()`: Prompts the user to input the elements of the array, then finds and prints the indices of the nearest neighbors.

## 3. ArrayConversion Class

### Description
This class converts an array to an ArrayList and vice versa.

### Methods
- `execute()`: Prompts the user to input the elements of the array, converts it to an ArrayList, prompts the user to input the elements of an ArrayList, and then converts it back to an array.
